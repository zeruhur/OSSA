# Character Generation

When creating a character, first you have to determine ability scores, roll 3d6 six times. For a more old school experience, you have to roll in the given order below from Strenght to Charisma. 

If you want to shape the character more, you may assign the results in any order you prefer. 

Remember what you are aiming to: the character is maybe heroic, maybe not, but not a hero at all, especially in the beginning.

The basic attributes of a character are:

- Strength: represents the character’s physical power. It is the Prime Attribute for Fighters, so when a Fighter character has Strength of 15+, the character gets a 5% bonus to XP. Fighters can use their Strength Bonus to modify their “to-hit” and damage results when using melee weapons.

- Dexterity: is a combination of coordination and quickness. It is the Prime Attribute for Thieves (if they are used). A high Dexterity score (15+) gives a character a bonus on “to-hit” rolls when attacking with a bow or other ranged weapon, and a low score (8 or less) gives a penalty of -1 to such rolls. Dexterity can be used to modify a character’s Armor Class.

- Constitution: refers to the health and endurance of a character. A high Constitution score (15+) gives the character a +1 to each hit die, and a low score (6 or lower) gives a –1 penalty to each hit die.

- Intelligence: represents IQ, reasoning, and the ability to solve puzzles or un-derstand difficult concepts. A high Intelligence score gives a character an additional language for every point above 10. Intelligence is the Prime Attribute for Magic-users, who will get a 5% bonus to XP if the character’s Intelligence is 15+. Magic-users can use their Intelligence Bonus to improve “spell effectiveness” (i.e. target suffers a loss on his saving throw).

- Wisdom: determines a character’s insight, perception, and good judgment. Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics. Any character with a Wisdom score of 15+ gets a 5% bonus to XP, and a Cleric character with Wisdom 15+ gets another 5% (total of 10%) because it is the Prime Attribute for the Cleric class. Clerics can use their Wisdom Bonus to improve “spell effectiveness” (i.e. target suffers a loss on his saving throw).

- Charisma: refers to a character’s leadership ability. Any character with a Charisma of 15+ receives a 5% bonus to XP. 

## Charisma Bonus

Charisma also determines the number of Non-Player Character (NPC) hirelings a character can acquire. These hirelings include specialists (ship captains, assassins, etc.) and non-human creatures, but do not usually include basic men-at-arms. Charisma modifies the loyalty of these NPCs.

| **Charisma Bonus** |


| --- | --- | --- |
| **Charisma** | **Hirelings (Max #)** | **Loyalty** |
| 3–4 | 1 | -2 |
| 5–6 | 2 | -2 |
| 7–8 | 3 | -1 |
| 9–12 | 4 | 0 |
| 13–15 | 5 | +1 |
| 16–17 | 6 | +2 |
| 18 | 7 | +2 |

## Attribute Bonus

Once determined the six attributes values, use the following table to assign the correct Bonus to increase the effect that these scores have.

Feel free to change the values. For example, if you prefer the “average” range to be 9–12, adjust the table.

| **Attribute Bonus** |


| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attribute Roll** | **Description** | **Bonus** |
| 3-6 | Below Average | -1  |
| 7-14 | Average | 0   |
| 15-18 | Above Average | +1  |

## Hit Points

Hit points (HP) represent the amount of “damage” a character can take before dying: they are determined by the number of hit dice (HD) the character has at each level, which is found in the description of each character class later on. 

To determine Hit Points, roll the number of dice, plus modifier, indicated in the character Class description for the current level. Re-roll Hit Points every time the character will gain a level.

## Single character party

Not everybody want to play a whole party in solo adventures. This is a perfectly fine preference, but some adjustements are necessary to make a more resistent character which will adventure in danger places alone:

1. When you determine the attributes, roll 4d6 instead of 3d6 and drop the lowest die.

2. Assign the whole value of the Hit Dice, instead of rolling them.

3. (Optional) Start the adventure with a level 3 character.

4. (Recommended) Assign one or two henchmen to the character, especially if you want to play a character not proficient in melee combat. Be aware of the hiring cost of henchmen, they have to be payed at their usual . Remember that hirelings and henchman do have a loyality to test in dangerous situations.
