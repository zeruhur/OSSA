title: Character Generation


---

OSSA is designed for solo playing with a single character. As it is fully compatible with WhiteBox, every character class is usable, but the default single character class in this game is the Adventurer.

## Character Generation Procedure

1. Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest die six times to determine ability scores.
2. Assign the results in any order you prefer.
    (optional) For a more old school experience, assign them in the given order from Strength to Charisma.
3. Write down bonuses:
    - basic attributes bonus
    - number of languages (Intelligence bonus)
    - number of hirelings (Charisma Bonus)
4. Assign the whole value of the Hit Dice for the current character level (6 at the 1st level).
5. Roll Magic Dice to determine how many spells the character starts with. Choose spells in number equal to this roll.
6. The character starts the game with 3d6x10 gold pieces.
7. Buy equipment, including weapons and armor.
8. Choose race and alignment
9. Choose a name
